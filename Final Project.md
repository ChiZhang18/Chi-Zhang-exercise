==========

This report was made by Chi Zhang, UTEID: cz6753.

Overview
---------------------------------

The pop music market, especially in recent years, is remarkably broad. Songs inspire generations from all walks of life. Every day, oceans of tracks jump to Billboard's Top 200 list. In this project, we collect the data of the 2019 popular music database from the record chart, Billboard 200, and built linear and non-linear prediction models for the overall song streams, and enhanced prediction performance compared to baseline models. More than that, I also segmented the songs into five groups through unsupervised algorithms and estimated the popularity trend for various groups throughout the year. The result of this project can help digital music servers improve playlist song recommendations, and help record companies make album promotion decisions.

Data Sources
