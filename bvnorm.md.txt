Simulating stocks and bonds under a bivariate normal
----------------------------------------------------

In this case study, you'll use historical data on stock and bond
returns, in order to simulate the performance of a portfolio under
various assumptions about the correlation between these two assets.

### Preliminaries

First load the `mosaic` and `mvtnorm` libraries.

    library(mosaic)
    library(mvtnorm)

Next, read in the function from my website that allows easy simulation
under the bivariate normal model:

Simulating portfolios
---------------------

There are three key ingredients for simulating a portfolio of stocks and
bonds (specifically, [ten-year U.S. treasury
bonds](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybond.asp), although
the same idea works for any asset class.)

First, we need some statistical assumptions about the performance of
these assets. Let's start with these:  
- stocks have a long-term average net return of 6.5%, net of inflation,
with a standard deviation of 19.5%.  
- 10-year treasury bonds have a long-term average net return of 1.7%,
with a standard deviation of 7.5%.  
- the correlation between stock and bond returns in any given year is
-0.15.

Second, we need a probability model based on these statistical
assumptions that allows us to simulate from the joint distribution of
stocks and bonds. A natural candidate is the bivariate normal. Here are
the parameters we'll use:

    mu_stocks = 0.065
    mu_bonds = 0.017
    sd_stocks = 0.195
    sd_bonds = 0.075
    rho = -0.15 

As a reminder, we call the `rbvnorm` function with these parameters in
order to simulate random draws from this joint distribution. For
example, here's where 50 years of returns simulated from these model
looks like:

    returns = rbvnorm(50, mu_stocks, mu_bonds, sd_stocks, sd_bonds, rho)
    plot(returns)

Finally, we need a way of chaining together our investment performance
across the years, to simulate a single imaginary future. We do this
using a for loop. For example, the following loop allowed us to simulate
one 40-year investment trajectory of a portfolio with stocks only, under
a (one-variable) normal model:

    Wealth = 10000
    Horizon = 40
    for(year in 1:Horizon) {
      return_stocks = rnorm(1, mu_stocks, sd_stocks)
        Wealth = Wealth * (1 + return_stocks)
    }
    Wealth

    ## [1] 51741.8

We can easily extend this idea to a bivariate normal model for stocks
and bonds, tracking our wealth in each asset at each step. Here we
assume an 60/40 allocation of wealth to stocks and bonds, respectively:

    total_wealth = 10000
    weights = c(0.6, 0.4) # how much of your wealth in each asset?
    wealth_by_asset = total_wealth * weights
    Horizon = 40
    for(year in 1:Horizon) {
      # Simulate a bivariate normal set of returns
      returns = rbvnorm(1, mu_stocks, mu_bonds, sd_stocks, sd_bonds, rho)
      # Update wealth in each asset
        wealth_by_asset = wealth_by_asset * (1 + returns)
        # rebalance
        total_wealth = sum(wealth_by_asset)
        wealth_by_asset = total_wealth * weights
    }
    total_wealth

### The case study

The goal of this case study is simple: to understand how the correlation
between stocks and bonds affects the long-term performance of your
investment portfolio. After all, this correlation isn't constant.
Rather, [it changes over time in response to larger macro-economic
forces.](https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2014/sep/pdf/bu-0914-8.pdf)

Suppose that you start with $10,000, and that you allocate 60% of your
money to stocks (with the remaining 40% to bonds). Use Monte Carlo
simulation to answer the following questions:  
1. What are the mean and standard deviation of simulated wealth after 40
years, assuming that stocks and bonds have a correlation of -0.3?  
2. What if stocks and bonds instead have a positive correlation of 0.3?

In each case, assume that you rebalance your portfolio every year to
retain the target 60/40 allocation.

The same script that you build for this case study can be used to
investigate any set of assumptions about the statistical properties of
future stock/bond returns.

### The data

In this (optional) section, I'll walk through the process of estimating
historical returns for stocks and bonds. We'll use the following dat:  
[stocks\_bonds.csv](http://jgscott.github.io/teaching/data/stocks_bonds.csv):
historical returns (1928 - 2016) of the S&P 500 stock index and 10-year
treasury bonds.

Download this data and read it in, using the Import Dataset button.

Let's make histograms of these data here, just to get a sense of what
we're working with:

    hist(stocks_bonds$SP500)

![](bvnorm_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)

    hist(stocks_bonds$TBOND10)

![](bvnorm_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png)

### Estimating the long-term mean and standard deviations

Let's calculate the historical average returns for stocks and 10-year
treasury bonds. Because we're talking about financial returns here, the
most appropriate measure of "average" is the [geometric
mean](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/071113/breaking-down-geometric-mean.asp),
rather than the more usual arithmetic mean:

    mu_stocks_gross = exp(mean(log(1+stocks_bonds$SP500))) - 1
    mu_bonds_gross = exp(mean(log(1+stocks_bonds$TBOND10))) - 1

These are gross returns, without accounting for inflation. To get a net
average return, we'll subtract the long-term average inflation rate of
3.2%:

    mu_stocks = mu_stocks_gross - 0.032
    mu_bonds = mu_bonds_gross - 0.032

Calculating the standard deviations is a bit easier:

    apply(stocks_bonds, 2, sd)

    ##        Year       SP500     TBOND10 
    ## 25.83602137  0.19702674  0.07762964
